# Implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression
## Aim
To write a python program to implement multivariate linear regression and predict the output.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
step1
Import required Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

Step2
Load the dataset (e.g., from a CSV file).

Step3
Define the features (X) and target (y).

Step4
Create and train the regression model.

Step5
Check the coefficients and intercept of the trained model.

Step6
Use the model to make a prediction with new input data.



## Program:
```






```
## Output:

### Insert your output

<br>

## Result
Thus the multivariate linear regression is implemented and predicted the output using python program.
